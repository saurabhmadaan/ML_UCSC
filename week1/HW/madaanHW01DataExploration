\section{Part 1 - HW01pb1data.csv}
\subsection{Attributes}
The dataset has 800 observations of 5 variables. The first 3 columns are \emph{integers} whereas the 4th and 5th columns are \emph{factors}.

In R, this can be seen using the following commands: 

\lstinputlisting[linerange=Q1s-Q1e]{HW1_1.R}


\subsection{Reason for Categorical Variables}
Columns 4 and 5 mostly have integers in them, but when one looks in to the \emph{levels}, it is quickly visible that they also have strings ``thirty five" and ``twenty five", respectively. Consequently, \emph{R} treats them as factors. 

Below are the R commands which provide more details:
\lstinputlisting[linerange=Q2s-Q2e]{HW1_1.R}


\subsection{Plots for numeric and categorical variables}

1. Plot of the 1st column (numerical data)
\lstinputlisting[linerange=Q31s-Q31e]{HW1_1.R}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{13a.pdf}
\caption{Plotting the numerical,1st column data}
\end{figure}

The y-axis of this plot are the values of the first column data, plotted against the index (row number) at which they occur in the dataset. This is a \emph{scatter-plot} for a numerical data type


2. Plot of the 4th column (categorical data)
\lstinputlisting[linerange=Q32s-Q32e]{HW1_1.R}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{13b.pdf}
\caption{Plotting the categorical, 4th column data}
\end{figure}
This graph is a distribution: it is a \emph{histogram} with the x-axis showing the values in the 4th column of our dataset, and the y-axis depicts the frequency with which values occur in a specified range. This graph is default since the 4th column data happens to be a categorical variable in our dataset.

\section{Part 2 - HW01pb2data.csv}

\subsection{Extract a random sample of 10k observations}
I used the \emph{sample} command in \emph{R} to obtain a smaller sample composed of 10,000 random records from our dataset. 

Below are the R commands used to read and structure the data:

\lstinputlisting[linerange=Q1s-Q1e]{HW1_2.R}


\subsection{Descriptive Stats on Sample}
Below are the commands used to compute the mean, max, variance and 1st quartile from the data.

The resulting values are included as comments in the below code (mean =9.41002, max=16.93748, var=4.004991).
\lstinputlisting[linerange=Q2s-Q2e]{HW1_2.R}


\subsection{Descriptive Stats for the Entire data}

Below is the \emph{R} code to compute descriptive stats for the entire dataset.
\lstinputlisting[linerange=Q3s-Q3e]{HW1_2.R}

The population values for these parameters are very close to those that we found for the smaller sample. The table below shows the comparison.

\begin{table}[h]

\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | p{5cm} |}
\hline
Statistic & Small Sample & Entire-Dataset \\
\hline
Mean & 9.41002 & 9.451468 \\
Max & 16.93748 & 18.96657\\
Variance & 4.004991 & 4.001822\\
1st Quartile & 8.079612 & 8.10388\\

\section{ Analysis of Ocean-view and Desert Home Prices}
\subsection{Box Plots for Pricing Data}
\emph{R} code for box plots: 
\lstinputlisting[linerange=Q1s-Q1e]{HW1_3.R}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{31.pdf}
\caption{Comparison of prices between desert and ocean-view and desert houses}
\end{figure}

The BoxPlot shows the distribution of prices between the two kinds of houses. Desert View houses have a much lower price than Ocean-view houses. The edges of the box indicate the 1st and last quartiles-- the median value (bold line) is much closer to the 25th percentile for desert view houses, indicating that the median is lower than the mean for desert houses. Finally, although the desert view houses are less expensive on average, the most expensive desert homes have a higher price (over 2.5 million dollars) than the most expensive ocean-view houses (less than 2.5 million dollars).

\subsection{Frequency Histogram for Ocean-view Houses}
\emph{R} code for histogram: 
\lstinputlisting[linerange=Q2s-Q2e]{HW1_3.R}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{32.pdf}
\caption{Histogram for prices of the ocean-view houses (0 to 3 million dollars)}
\end{figure}

\subsection{ECDF for House Prices}
\emph{R} code for ecdf plots: 
\lstinputlisting[linerange=Q3s-Q3e]{HW1_3.R}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{33.pdf}
\caption{ECDF for Desert and Ocean-view Houses}
\end{figure}

\section{Analyzing Data for Orange Trees}
\subsection{Age vs. Circumference relation}
We first explore the data to identify the 3 variables: Tree, age, circumference. Using the \emph{summary} command on the dataset outputs useful information, including the (min,max) parameters for age and circumference, and the different levels for 'Tree' (1,2,3,4,5).

x-axis (age) ranges from 118-152, and y-axis (circumference) ranges from 30-214.

Below is the \emph{R} code for the same:

\lstinputlisting[linerange=Q1s-Q1e]{HW1_4.R}

The resulting plot shows the variation of tree circumference with age,  for the different groups/levels of trees.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{41.pdf}
\caption{Age vs. Circumference, for the 5 groups of Orange Trees}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Correlation between age and circumference for 1st Tree type}
The two variables (age, circumference) are strongly correlated, with a correlation value of 0.9854675. 

\emph{R} code: 
\lstinputlisting[linerange=Q2s-Q2e]{HW1_4.R}


\subsection{Covariance and Correlation for Each Tree-type}
Approach: Create an empty data frame with the different tree groups as the first column. Then, leverage the \emph{by} command to calculate the parameters for each group. This saves having to individually calculate and \emph{merge} results.

Below is the \emph{R} code with results: 
\lstinputlisting[linerange=Q3s-Q3e]{HW1_4.R}


\subsection{Effect of Adding 10 to each Circumference value}
Correlation and covariance remain \emph{unchanged}.

Below is the \emph{R} code with results: 
\lstinputlisting[linerange=Q4s-Q4e]{HW1_4.R}

\subsection{Effect of Doubling Circumference}
Covariance \emph{doubles} and correlation remains \emph{unchanged}.

Below is the \emph{R} code with results: 
\lstinputlisting[linerange=Q5s-Q5e]{HW1_4.R}

\subsection{Effect of Multiplying Circumference by -2}
Covariance becomes negative (and double in magnitude compared to the original dataset), and correlation becomes \emph{negative} of its original value. Results:

New covariance = original covariance * (-2)

New correlation = -original correlation

Below is the \emph{R} code with results: 
\lstinputlisting[linerange=Q6s-Q6e]{HW1_4.R}


\section{Desert Homes: Revisited}

\subsection{Calculating the Median Price}
Approach: \emph{R} does not have a native \emph{median} function, so we define a custom \emph{median} function to calculate the median home price. This results in:

Below is the \emph{R} code with results: 
\lstinputlisting[linerange=Q1s-Q1e]{HW1_5.R}


Median value: 89

Mean value: 144.0348

(note: the values are in units of thousand dollars).

Median is \emph{smaller} than the mean. 

\subsection {Characteristics of the Distribution}
We found earlier that the median is lower than the mean. This generally indicates that the distribution is positively, or \emph{right-skewed}. 

This can be further confirmed by plotting a histogram to get a sense of the distribution, as shown below.
 
\lstinputlisting[linerange=Q2s-Q2e]{HW1_5.R}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{52.pdf}
\caption{Histogram showing desert home prices}
\end{figure}

\FloatBarrier
\subsection {Effect of Higher Home Prices on Median Value}
If we increase house price by 10 (thousand dollars) each, the median value \emph{increases} by the same amount. 

Specifically, the new median (99k) is higher than the old median (89k) by 10 (thousand dollars).
Below is the \emph{R} code with results: 
\lstinputlisting[linerange=Q3s-Q3e]{HW1_5.R}


\subsection {Effect of Doubling Home Prices on Median Value}
If home prices double, the median value also \emph{doubles}.

Specifically, the new median (178k) is twice the old median (89k). Below is the \emph{R} code with results: 
\lstinputlisting[linerange=Q4s-Q4e]{HW1_5.R}

\section{Closing Notes and References}

I read material from \emph{The Art of R Programming} by Norman Matloff for an introduction to \emph{R}, and googled online references for the use of the \emph{by} command. 

Tools used include the \emph{R} package for Mac, \emph{TeXShop} for writing Latex files. I did \emph{not} collaborate with another class member on this assignment.

Included in my submission is this \emph{pdf} file, and all the \emph{R} files where my code is programmed.
